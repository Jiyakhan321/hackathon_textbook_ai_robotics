## Prompt

```
/sp.constitution
- Goal: Create a complete interactive 3D textbook on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
- Focus: Embodied AI systems bridging digital brain and physical body.
- Scope: 4 modules + Capstone project.
- Framework: Docusaurus for book structure, React Three Fiber (R3F) for 3D interactivity.
- Target audience: Students with basic AI, Python, and robotics knowledge.
```

## Response snapshot

Constitution updated for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project with focus on interactive 3D learning, embodied intelligence, and multi-modal educational design. The updated constitution includes 6 core principles tailored to the project goals, technology stack using Docusaurus and React Three Fiber, and development workflow considerations for 3D interactive content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated constitution to align with Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project goals
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Modified .specify/memory/constitution.md with new project-specific principles
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with creating spec, plan, and tasks for the textbook
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now properly reflects the specialized nature of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics educational project

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
