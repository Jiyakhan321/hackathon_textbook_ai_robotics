# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to Embodied Intelligence

This book teaches you how to build AI systems that operate in the physical world by controlling humanoid robots in simulation and real environments. We'll explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on practical, hands-on learning.

### What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive guide, you'll master the complete pipeline of physical AI systems:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System** - Master ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, topics, services, and URDF for humanoid robots
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin** - Create physics-accurate simulations with Gazebo and Unity, including sensor modeling
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain** - Implement NVIDIA Isaac for synthetic data, SLAM, and navigation systems
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action** - Build multimodal AI systems with voice commands, LLM planning, and action execution

### Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental AI concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

### Tools We'll Use

All tools in this book are open-source or have free alternatives:
- ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill)
- Gazebo simulation environment
- Unity (with free tier)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Docusaurus for documentation
- Python and common AI libraries
