# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to the foundation of robotic systems! In this module, you'll learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the communication backbone that enables different components of a robot to work together. Think of ROS 2 as the nervous system of a robot - it allows sensors, actuators, controllers, and AI systems to communicate seamlessly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Implement topics, services, and actions for inter-component communication
- Design URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files for humanoid robots
- Build simple robotic systems that communicate via ROS 2

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with command line interfaces
- Docker (optional, for isolated ROS 2 environment)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into several key sections:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture** - Understanding nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. **Python Agents with rclpy** - Creating ROS 2 nodes in Python
3. **URDF Modeling** - Defining robot structure and properties
4. **Practical Exercises** - Hands-on projects to reinforce concepts

Let's begin by exploring the fundamental architecture of ROS 2!
